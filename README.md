# Introduction 
Built this out to showcase how Azure Dev Ops can be leveraged for bringing an existing solution into source code so that it can be branched, worked in isolated Power Platform Environments, and deployed to target environments

# Getting Started
This solution is not plug and play. You will need to update ADO Service Connections and their use in the yaml in order to get this to work.  There are several other things that need to be tweaked to get to work in a different environment as well that I will document when I have time.
